Poetic Summary: The Treasuer Island
Author: Robert Louis Stevenson

Men of great fortune
Over the dead man's chest
Rumble away the old sea tune
Till the masts are high upto crest

A cruise to seek the unseen gold
Hidden away from the sneery eyes
The map of an isle unseen, untold
Shook the woods with hideous cries

Mutiny broke to chaotic tyranny
Split the crew to two
Over the one legged hawk's felony
Stood the old curse true

Marooned pirate,unskilled lad
Oh! What a crew to be brave 
Finally saw the seamen sad
Whence whipped away the gilded grave 

An account of the old sea
Still shudders the bones
A voyage for the reader to see
Penned by the author long known.
