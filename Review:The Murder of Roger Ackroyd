Book Review: The Murder of Roger Ackroyd
Author: Agatha christie

A crime and mystery story usually has a detective tailing a criminal over a grave crime or murder. Not all
stories are this plain and Agatha Christie's "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" stands highlighted on the shelf 
for the fact that the criminal is the constant companion of the detective in the story. Taken over by greed
and clean chance to bag luxuries, a doctor ends up killing the prominent characters yet masking the crime
skillfully. The time flow and juggling of the events surely leaves the reader to guess for possibilities,
yet every thoughtbeing decieved by a different reveal.An absolute page turner written in well descriptive form
arousing sense of animation through the words. One can surely visualize the actions of the detective till
the end which compels to stay put till the culprit and crime is disclosed.
